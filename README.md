# Guessing How a Raytracer Works, in C

I have some very naive knowledge about how a raytracer works, and kinda remember
what a reflectance distribution function is from a computer vision class. I wanted to see
if I could get something viable without Googling anything about raytracers
(so deriving the necessary math as well). Also, in C, just because. 

After a couple hours I was pretty surprised to get something that looks sorta legit.
